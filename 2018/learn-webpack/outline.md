  - Dev @ RU for 2.5 yrs
    - React, React Native, Ionic, Angular, Node, GraphQL, etc, etc
- What is Webpack?
  - Module bundler
  - Not a task runner (i.e. grunt)
  - Enables writing modular code for a web project
- Story Time
  - Starter project with modules

- Disclaimer
  - Tip of the iceberg
  - Generalities & high-level discussion
- Key Concepts
  - Entry (next slide)
  - Output
    - Where and what format you want the output of webpack to go
  - Mode
    - Environment setting for Webpack
    - Will optimize if set to production
  - Loaders (later) think transform
  - Plugins
    - Modules that tap into Webpack's compiler events (think build process changes)
- Entry
  - Beginning of the dependency graph
- Example config
- Buckle up!
- Project Overview
  - A couple JS files used in an index file
- Webpack config for this project
  - Run it
  - Show output -- OH GOD WHAT HAVE WE DONE
- What's it doing?
  - IIFE pattern
    - object with each of the file paths as the property name
  - Creates its own require statement
  - Passes your entry file into the custom require
  - Eval statement with your code. It has replaced all of your require statements with its custom require statement
- How does it get there?
  - Parts of this process are recursive
  - Build a dep graph -- all the files and the files they depend on
  - Create modules -- JS objects with context about the file
  - Run loaders (transforms)
  - Parse the files (AST)
  - Create the output template (interpolation)
- Slimpack Config
  - Very similar to our Webpack Config
  - Explain Output
  - Update index.html to point to slimbundle!
- Loaders
- CSS Loader
- CSS Loader Config
  - Update config
  - Update index.js to point to style file
  - Run Slimpack
  - Explain Output
  - Show that it works
  - Nothing will show up in the DOM
- Style Loader
  - Update Config
  - ! Loaders processed from right to left
  - Explain output
- Thank you!
